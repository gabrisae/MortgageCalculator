I kept digging myself into a hole trying to figure out the versions of kotlin to use, I kept getting 
issues of why it kept rejecting my build. I might end up having to delete Android Studio and reinstalling 
it is so slow and sometimes the emulator will not work until restarting my computer once or twice.
I tried my best, please let me know what I did wrong, I probably ended up overthinking the issue
and I would really like to know how to fix it. Thank you.
